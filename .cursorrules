## UI / UX conventions (MANDATORY)
- Add `cursor-pointer` to all interactive UI elements:
  - any element with `@click`, clickable `button`, `a`, `select`, checkbox + its label.
  - If using third‑party UI (e.g. Schedule‑X), add scoped CSS overrides to enforce pointer cursor.
- If a list has zero items, show an explicit **empty state** (no blank cards/blocks).
- Clicking calendar items must open an edit popup with **edit + delete** actions.

## Code quality conventions (MANDATORY)
- Keep Vue components small. If a component grows > ~120 lines or has complex logic:
  - move logic into a composable in `app/composables/`
  - move pure helpers into `app/helpers/`
- Do not introduce `any`. Prefer narrow unions and `unknown` + type guards.
- Prefer store-level filtering for global behavior (e.g. hiding completed tasks).

## Libraries / docs
- When integrating external libraries, validate usage against the latest docs (Dec 2025+).
- Schedule‑X:
  - event ids must be querySelector-safe (letters/digits/_/-)
  - use Temporal types (`Temporal.ZonedDateTime` / `Temporal.PlainDate`) for start/end

  Use yarn


  # Project Instructions
## Code Style

- Maximize split code
- Maximize code re-usage
- Create utils, helpers, constants in corresponded folders.
- Always split big chunk of code, starting from 300 lines.
- Explicitly declare all types
- Avoid using any type
  
## Architecture
- Follow the repository pattern
- Keep business logic in service layers
- Run Linter and build after each task
- Update documentation after updating logi
- move logic into hooks, do not overgrow components
